# Understanding the MultiThreadedDom Class in Depth

## Overview

The `MultiThreadedDom` class is designed to handle a multi-threaded Depth of Market (DOM) display. It uses Java's concurrent collections and Swing UI components to achieve this. The class listens to depth data updates, processes them in batches, and updates the DOM table in the UI.

## Key Components

### Data Structures

- `ConcurrentSkipListMap<Integer, Integer> bids, asks`: These are thread-safe sorted maps that store bid and ask prices and their sizes.
- `BlockingQueue<DepthData> depthDataQueue`: A thread-safe queue that stores incoming depth data.
- `ReentrantLock bidsLock, asksLock`: Locks to ensure thread safety when updating bids and asks.

### Inner Classes

- `DepthData`: A static inner class that encapsulates the properties of a depth data point (isBid, price, size).
- `CustomTableCellRenderer`: A static inner class for custom table cell rendering.

### Threading

- `ExecutorService executorService`: Manages the background thread for batch processing.

## Methods

### `initialize()`

Initializes the executor service and UI components. It also starts the batch processing of depth data.

### `startBatchProcessing()`

Runs in a separate thread and continually processes batches of depth data. It updates the DOM if there are any changes.

### `processBatchData()`

Drains the `depthDataQueue` into a list and updates the bid and ask books accordingly.

### `updateBook(DepthData data)`

Updates the bid or ask book based on the incoming `DepthData`. It uses `ReentrantLock` to ensure thread safety.

### `throttleBatchProcessing()`

Puts the batch processing thread to sleep for a specified interval to throttle the processing rate.

### `initUI()`

Initializes the Swing UI components. It sets up a JFrame containing a JTable to display the DOM.

### `onDepth(boolean isBid, int price, int size)`

Called when a new depth data point is received. It offers the new data to the `depthDataQueue`.

### `updateDOM()`

Updates the DOM table in the UI if there are any changes in the bid or ask books.

### `refreshTableData()`

Refreshes the table model data based on the current state of the bid and ask books.

### `populateBidData()` and `populateAskData()`

Populate the bid and ask data into the table model.

### `stop()`

Attempts to shut down the executor service gracefully.

## Exception Handling

The code uses try-catch blocks extensively to log exceptions using `Log.info()`.

## Custom Rendering

The `CustomTableCellRenderer` class is used to set custom colors for the Bid and Ask columns in the table.
